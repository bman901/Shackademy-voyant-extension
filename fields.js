// Each entry needs:
//   key      - the value of the parent <label>'s `for` attribute, or its `id`
//              if it has no `for`. Find it by inspecting the label in DevTools.
//   label    - human-readable name, for the modal heading only (not used in logic)
//   helpText - HTML string. Use <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong> etc. freely.
//              This is hardcoded content so HTML is safe here.
//
// Optional:
//   lessonUrl - Shackademy lesson link. Omit if none.
//   videoUrl  - YouTube link in any format (will be auto-converted to embed).
//
// If both lessonUrl and videoUrl are absent, the modal shows text only (no tabs).
// If only lessonUrl is present, a button appears in the Details panel (no tabs).
// If videoUrl is present, a Video tab appears alongside Details.
//

    <h3>What to enter</h3>
    <p>If setting a preferred payment source, use the "Only Use Preferred Sources" to Pay the Expense very sparingly, if at all.
    <br>
    When ticked, this setting can create artificial shortfalls if the preferred source is inadequately funded to pay the linked expense. These artificial shortfalls can prevent Voyant’s need analysers from returning results.
    <br>
    <strong>When might you tick the “Only Use…”option? </strong>
    <br>
    In most cases, we recommend only using this setting in a what-if scenario.
    <br>
    For example, suppose you are saving for your children’s university fees and you want to run a test to determine if you are saving enough to a particular account.
    <br>
    Even if the account is set as a preferred payment source, income and other assets sources will be used if the account does not have the funds to meet the linked expense.
    <br>
    However, by selecting the “Only Use Preferred Payment Sources” option, you could, in this scenario, test the account for adequate funding.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bypass Trust & Loan Trusts</strong> - Trusts do not form part of the liquidation order. Voyant will not take adhoc/as needed withdrawals to fulfil expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Discounted Gift Trusts (DGT)</strong> - A DGT does not form part of the liquidation order however Voyant will make automatic planned withdrawals from the investment.<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Investment Schemes (EIS)</strong> - EIS investments do not form part of the liquidation order. Adhoc withdrawals will not be taken from these investments. If withdrawals are needed these will need to be set up as Planned Withdrawals.<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Lifetime ISA</strong> - Treated as a Tax Free asset. Voyant will not access until the owner is over the required age.</li>
        <li><strong>Onshore bond</strong> - Treated as a Tax Deferred asset. Voyant will treat withdrawals as tax deferred up to the allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Offshore bond</strong> - Treated as a Tax Deferred asset. Voyant will treat withdrawals as tax deferred up to the allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Offshore Taxable</strong> - Treated as a Tax Deferred asset. With this investment you can set the level of taxation as you choose.<sup>3</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Stocks Market ISA/ Junior ISA</strong> - Treated by Voyant as a Tax Free asset. Voyant will use the appropriate ISA allowance depending on whether an adult or child is selected as the owner.</li>
        <li><strong>Unwrapped investments</strong> - Treated as a Taxable asset. Voyant use unwrapped investments as the catch-all category for all manner of Taxable investments that are not subject to the special tax treatments. OEICs, unit trusts, equity holdings, stocks and shares, individual equities, businesses and even properties can all be modelled under the guise of unwrapped investments.</li>
        <li><strong>Venture Capital Trusts (VCT)</strong> - VCT's do not form part of the liquidation order. Adhoc withdrawals will not be taken from these investments. If withdrawals are needed these will need to be set up as Planned Withdrawals.<sup>4</sup></li>

      <p>'Year Qualifying for IHT Exemption' this is the date that the relief will be given i.e. after the 2 year qualifying period.</p>
      <p><strong>New Investments</strong></p>
      <p>For new, qualifying investments, IHT relief typically occurs 2 years after the transfer or contribution made into the investment.</p>

      <p>This means that for a qualifying investment set up by a transfer in 2024, IHT relief will apply in Voyant from the end of 2026 (2 years) i.e. showing on Voyant at the start of 2027.</p>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Restricted Stock Unit:</strong> shares that vest over time. There is normally no exercise price.</li>
        <li><strong>Company Share Option:</strong> an option to buy shares at a specified exercise price.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI):</strong> a UK tax-advantaged share option scheme, subject to qualifying conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Non Tax Advantage Share Option:</strong> a share option without the EMI-style tax advantages.</li>

      <h3>Future Grant tab</h3>
      <p>On the Future Grant tab, this same field may be used to describe how future grants are calculated rather than the legal/tax type of the original grant.</p>

    helpText: `
      <h3>What to enter</h3>
      <p>Two options are available to set how incomes will be taken from money purchases. These are UFPLS and Flexi (Flexible Access Drawdown) and they determine whether an element of taxable income will be included in each withdrawal or if withdrawals are to be taken entirely from the pension owner’s tax-free cash allowance if available.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Flexible Access Drawdown</strong> = Allows scheduled withdrawals from money purchase pensions to be taken from the owner's tax-free cash allowance first. The total withdrawal amount specified will be tax free assuming enough tax free cash remains in the pension. With each amount withdrawn tax free, an additional 75% is crystallised and moved into a linked drawdown account, which Voyant creates automatically.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Please Note</strong> - The Flexible Access Drawdown option can only work if the amount you are withdrawing is less than the pension’s overall tax-free cash allowance, which is normally 25% of the pension’s balance.
      <br>
      For example, if you were to schedule a withdrawal of <strong>50% of a pension’s total balance</strong>, Voyant will withdraw this amount. It will not limit withdrawals to only the tax-free allowance.
      <br>
      You will receive a combination of taxable and tax-free cash, and in this example you would receive the full amount of tax free cash available (25%) with another 25% paid as a taxable amount.
      <br><br>
      <strong>UFPLS</strong> = Withdrawals the amount as 25% tax free and 75% potentially taxable. This is also Voyant’s default for 'as needed' withdrawals taken from money purchase pensions.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Please Note:</strong> The above examples do not account for any protected tax free cash you may have, in these instances the amount of tax free cash may be higher than the figures stated above.</p>      
      <br><br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Pension Strategy window will not appear if only drawdown accounts are selected as there is no tax free element to them so all of the withdrawal is potentially taxable.</p>

      The Assumed Interest Rate on an annuity is the underlying interest rate assumption on which the annuity calculation is based (or would be based, by an actuary). It would ordinarily reflect an assumed yield on mid-dated UK Sovereign debt (Gilt Yield).

      <strong>Specified Annuity Rate</strong>
