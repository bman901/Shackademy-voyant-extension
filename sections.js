window.TAB_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  timing: `
    <p>The Timing tab controls <strong>when this item starts and ends</strong> in your plan. Voyant uses timeline events - milestones you define, like Retirement or a specific age - rather than fixed calendar dates, so your plan stays dynamic as assumptions change.</p>
    <p>Make sure the start and end events reflect your real expectations as accurately as possible, as they have a significant impact on your projections.</p>
  `,

  growth: `
    <p>The Growth tab sets the <strong>assumed annual rate of return</strong> for this item. Voyant uses this to project its future value over time.</p>
    <p>If left unchanged, Voyant uses the default growth assumption from Plan Settings. You can override it here for this specific item.</p>
    <p>Please note, once a plan is created this is the only place to update growth assumptions - the Plan Settings will only impact <strong>new</strong> plans created.</p>
    <p>Consider using a cautious assumption as your base case, and model a more optimistic scenario using a What If scenario to understand the range of possible outcomes.</p>
    <p>Our suggestion is to leave this on the default Entered Growth Rate until you're comfortable with Voyant.</p>
  `,

  steps: `
    <p>Steps allow you to model <strong>changes to this item at a future point in time</strong></p>
    <p>Each step is triggered by a timeline event. You can add as many steps as needed to reflect how this item is expected to change throughout the plan.</p>
  `,

  fees: `
    <p>The Fees tab lets you model <strong>product fees and advice fees</strong> associated with this account.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product fee</strong> - deducted from the gross growth rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing advice fee</strong> - modelled as a withdrawal from the account. Will generate a tax event where applicable (e.g. Capital Gains Tax for unwrapped investments).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensure the entered growth rate factors in any account fees. For example, if using the default growth rate of 5% you may want to gross this up to offset the fee reduction.</p>
  `,

  transfers: `
    <p>The Transfers tab is where you model <strong>one-off or regular movements of money between accounts</strong> already in your plan - for example, moving funds from a savings account into an ISA, or from one pension to another.</p>
    <p>Transfers do not create new income or expenses - they simply redistribute existing assets within the plan.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both the source and destination accounts must already exist in the plan before setting up a transfer</li>
      <li>Transfers are linked to timeline events so you can model them at a specific future date</li>
      <li>Transfers can also be used to invest surplus income by selecting 'All Surplus' as the 'Transfer From' account</li>
      <li>Check Year View after saving to confirm the source and destination balances move as expected</li>
    </ul>
  `,

  "liquidation-limits": `
    <p>The Withdrawal Limit tab controls <strong>how and when Voyant is allowed to access this account</strong> to meet expenses when other income falls short.</p>
    <p>Ensure the timing reflects when you want to allow access to this account</p>
    <p>The default setting is <em>As Needed</em>, meaning Voyant will draw from this account according to the liquidation order. You can restrict this - for example, to ringfence an emergency fund or prevent access until a specific life event.</p>
    <p>Note: withdrawal limits control <em>ad hoc</em> access. To model a planned, scheduled withdrawal regardless of whether it is needed, use the Planned Withdrawals screen instead.</p>
  `,

  drawdowns: `
    <p>Planned Withdrawals are <strong>scheduled withdrawals from a specific account</strong> that happen regardless of whether there is a shortfall to meet. This is different from the Withdrawal Limit tab, which only controls ad hoc access when income falls short.</p>
    <p>Use Planned Withdrawals when you want to model a deliberate strategy - for example, drawing a fixed annual income from a drawdown pension, or systematically running down an investment account over a set period.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'Selected Account' will default to the plan you were in when you chose to add a planned withdrawal</li>
      <li>For pension planned withdrawals, the Pension Strategy field on the pension entry determines whether withdrawals are UFPLS or Flexible Access Drawdown</li>
      <li>Check Year View > Cash Flow to confirm the withdrawal is appearing correctly</li>
    </ul>
